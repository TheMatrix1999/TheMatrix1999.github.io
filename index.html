        <h1>The First Real-Time, Frame-Level Moving Control for Realistic World Simulation!</h1>
        <p><strong>How close are we to realizing the vision of <em>The Matrix (1999)</em>, where AI crafts a fully
            immersive, interactive world, blurring the line between reality and illusion?</strong> Imagine a limitless
          digital universe, created in real-time with visuals that rival reality itself. This project is a pioneering
          step toward that vision—a first glimpse into humanity’s own "Matrix."</p>
        <p> Our system breaks new ground in world simulation by delivering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Frame-level precision</strong> in user interaction, matching the responsiveness portrayed in the
            film.</li>
          <li><strong>AAA-level visuals</strong> for immersive scenes nearly indistinguishable from reality.</li>
          <li><strong>Infinite generative capacity</strong> for endless exploration, surpassing the limits of current
            video models.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Curious?</strong> Read on to explore the technology powering <em>The Matrix</em> and experience the
          feel of a self-sustaining digital universe!</p>

      <h4>Comparison of Recent Generative Models for Game Simulation</h4>
      <p>
        <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> distinguishes itself as a foundation model capable of generating infinitely
        long videos with AAA game quality, high resolution, frame-level real-time control, and robust domain
        generalization. Here, * indicates concurrent work with <em>The Matrix</em>, and supervised/unsupervised refers

            the lines of various modernist buildings and their reflective glass surfaces create a sense of verticality,
            with glass curtain walls on the left and stone or concrete structures on the right. Shadows enhance the
            impression of height. An old building with intricate stone carvings and arched windows on the right adds a
            historical element. Towering leafless trees line both sides of the street, creating a tranquil winter or
            early spring atmosphere. Although streetlights and traffic signals are visible, they are rendered
            unnecessary by the emptiness of the street. Colorful signage and banners add vibrancy, suggesting the city's
            regular activities. The clear blue sky contrasts sharply with the detailed urban environment, highlighting

      <p, class="small-left">
        The <strong>Interactive Module</strong> consists of an Embedding block and a cross-attention layer, translating keyboard inputs into natural language commands for video generation. For example, pressing <code>W</code> becomes “The car is driving forward” in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> or “The man is moving forward and looking up” in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> when combined with upward mouse movement. For unlabeled data, a default description, “The camera is moving in an unknown way,” is applied.
        To enhance robustness, during training, we randomly replace labeled keyboard inputs with the default sentence with a probability q = 0.1.
        Before training, the base DiT model is warmed up using game and real-world data, fine-tuning a LoRA weight. This ensures the Interactive Module focuses on learning interactions and movement patterns, rather than simply fitting the video.

        <p, class="small-left">
          Traditional DiT models generate only short videos due to high computational costs and memory demands of attention mechanisms over extended durations. To overcome this, we propose the <strong>Shift-Window Denoise Process Models</strong> (<strong>Swin-DPM</strong>), leveraging a sliding temporal window to handle dependencies effectively and enable long or infinite video generation.
          As shown in the <strong>Figure</strong>, the Swin-DPM processes video tokens in a queue using denoising steps. Tokens are cached after denoising, maintaining continuity between windows. This fine-tuned model builds on pre-trained DiT, where the first window of tokens is used for warmup, and loss is computed only on subsequent tokens.
          At inference, warmup tokens are discarded, and video generation begins from the (w+1)-th token, enabling efficient and continuous video generation.

        The training process of <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> begins with a pretrained video DiT backbone. The <strong>Interactive Module</strong> is first warmed up with data from the <strong>GameData Platform</strong> using unsupervised LoRA to focus on movement rather than visuals. Subsequently, precise frame-level control is achieved through targeted training. With <strong>Swin-DPM</strong> enabling infinite-length generation and <strong>Stream Consistency Models (SCMs)</strong> ensuring real-time speeds, <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> delivers groundbreaking video simulations.

      <h1>Generate Infinte-Horizon <em>The Matrix</em> World</h3>
        <div class="text">
          <p>Current state-of-the-art DiT-based video generation models (e.g., CogVideo, Open-Sora) are limited to
            producing videos just a few seconds long, making them insufficient for creating
            an infinite-horizon world. <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong> overcomes this limitation by introducing
            Swin-DPM, which significantly extends the receptive
            field of attention computations while maintaining the same computational cost.
            This innovation enables the generation of high-quality, super-long-duration videos with consistent visuals,
            all within an achievable compute budget.</p>
